# Semi Auto Township

This mod automatically heals and repairs your township town, as well as fighting abyssal waves when optimal.

Once your township is profitable (with town halls), this allows you to fully idle township, without ever having to revisit your town to repair, heal, or handle abyssal waves.

## Settings
In the mod settings, you can set a cap that will prevent it from spending your whole bank on repairs. For example, if you set it to 10,000,000 GP, it will not repair if doing so would drop your GP pool under 10,000,000. This setting defaults to 0. If any issues arise from insufficient funds, please comment so I can address them.

For healing, you can select what resource to use, either herbs or potions. By default, this mod will select the one for which you have the highest income.

You can also enable an option to engage abyssal waves even if fortifications are not fully upgraded, although this will reduce XP efficiency and is recommended to be left off.

## Help
Repairing can be expensive at times, so it may be inadvisable to turn this on until your town is profitable.
