# Semi Auto Township

This mod automatically heals and repairs your township, as well as fighting abyssal waves when optimal. Once your township is profitable (with Town Halls), this allows you to fully idle township without having to revisit it to repair, heal, or manage abyssal waves.

## Settings
In the mod settings, you can fine-tune various aspects of how the mod manages your township. Below is a breakdown of each setting:

### GP Repair Cap
This setting controls the maximum amount of GP the mod will allow to be spent on repairs. If the repairs would drop your GP pool below the specified amount, the mod will stop repairing. The default value is 0, meaning no limit is enforced. You can set this cap to prevent the mod from draining your entire bank balance on costly repairs. For example, if you set it to 10,000,000 GP, the mod will avoid repairing if doing so would leave your GP under that amount.

### Healing Resource
You can choose whether to use **herbs** or **potions** for healing your town. By default, the mod will select the resource with the highest income. This ensures the healing process doesn't deplete your most valuable resource and helps sustain your town's overall health.

### Engage Abyssal Waves without Full Fortifications
There’s an option to engage Abyssal Waves even if your fortifications aren’t fully upgraded. While this allows you to fight waves earlier, it reduces XP efficiency. It’s recommended to leave this setting off for optimal XP gain.

### Minimum Armour and Weaponry
This setting reserves a portion of your armor and weaponry for trading, preventing the mod from using all of it in Abyssal Waves. If you notice that the mod is consuming all your armor and weaponry in fights when you intended to trade it, adjust this setting accordingly to maintain a balance between combat and trading resources.

### Auto Swap Equipment (New)
The **Auto Swap Equipment** feature automatically optimizes your township's equipment usage to reduce repair costs and increase XP gain per Abyssal Wave fought. This feature requires the [SEMI Core](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/semi-core) to be installed, as it allows automatic swapping of equipment when necessary. This setting is recommended to be turned on for better resource management and increased efficiency in wave battles.

## Help
- **Repairs**: Be cautious when enabling auto-repair if your town is not yet profitable. Repairs can become costly, so it may be best to leave this off until your town generates a stable GP income.
  
- **Abyssal Waves**: If you want to reserve armor and weapons for trading but notice that they are all being consumed by Abyssal Waves, use the **Minimum Armour and Weaponry** setting to adjust the balance between combat and trading resources.

- **Auto Swap Equipment**: If you have this setting on but your equipment is not swapping, be sure to install [SEMI Core](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/semi-core).
