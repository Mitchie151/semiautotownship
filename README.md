# Semi Auto Township

This mod automatically heals and repairs your township town.

Once township is profitable (with town halls), this allows you to fully idle township, without ever having to revisit your town to repair and heal.

## Settings
In the mod settings you can set a cap that will prevent it from spending your whole bank on repairs. I.e. if you set it to 10,000,000 it will not repair if doing so would drop your GP pool under 10,000,000. This setting defaults to 0. I haven't been able to see what happens if the system tries to repair with insufficient funds, so if you see something unusual here please comment so I can address it.

When healing, you can select what resource to use, either herbs or potions. By default, this mod will select the one for which you have the highest income.

## Help
Repairing can be expensive at times so it may be inadvisable to turn this on until your town is profitable.
